## What is does?
I implemented in Java various components of a command-line application simulating YouTube. The application has the following important features:
    - The method, playVideo(), have the variable “currentvideo” which keeps the current video. The ArrayList  “array”  keeps the title of the video every time a video is played and when the video stops, the video title is removed from the array.
    -The method, playRandomVideo(), has a list with all the videos and another one for the video’s id. The method adds all the video’s IDs to the list. I implemented the function Random to get a random video from the playlist and after I played the random video
    -The method, showPlaying(), displays the title, video_id video tags and paused video of the video that’s currently playing. The method uses the variable “ok” to check if the variable is paused and the variable “okStatus” to display the status of the video.

## :hammer_and_wrench: How I built it?
The comand-line application simulating Youtube is implemented in Java.

## :crossed_swords: Challenges I ran into
I knew how to work with Java but I encountered a lot of problems, for example: I implemented the method pauseVideo, I designed the method to pause the song from the playlist, but I didn't know how to play again the video from the state that I left the video, but with the help of the other students from Java group chat I managed to solve them.

## :trophy: What I learned and Accomplishments that I am proud of
- How to pause a video and play again the video from the state that I left.
